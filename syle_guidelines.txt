Style Guidelines

Overall Look and Feel of Adapt
===============================
Since Adapt is a tech company that sells smartphones, the overall feel of the website should match up to the competition. Thus, we want the website to feel like a modern tech website that properly showcases the AdaptPhone product and allows users to buy and order products.
The look of the website should be sleek, minimalist, and simple to use. It should be very user friendly; users should be able to navigate where they want with ease.

Colours
========
As a tech phone company, we want sleek and modern colours to match the rest of the industry, so that customers can easily understand what the website is trying to convey.
Color Palettes/Choices:
Use black, white, and grey gradients(already implemented in css file)
Use various shades of blues accent colours to emphasize parts

Iconography
===========
We have agreed on various icons to use that will be found in the project’s ‘img’ folder. Inside will contain various assets such as logos, tech icons, and phone designs.

Typography/Font
==========
We will be using Poppins (Sans Serif) from Google Fonts.

Clickable Elements (Buttons and Links)
=======
Clickable elements will light up white when a user hovers over it. Some buttons will actually darken when hovered as well.
